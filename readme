various experiments with programming language concepts. None of these are meant for serious use. Things implemented here are

1. Two scheme interpreters. Located at lisp.lisp and soop.scm.
2. An implementation of java-style oop in scheme using closures and macros (classes.scm)
3. A (bad) pattern matching system in scheme. Inspired by mathematica. (stephen.scm) (wolfram plz don't sue me)
4. A lazily evaluated programming language (pretty much a lambda calc interpreter) located at lazy.scm
5. A (failed) experiment in doing smalltalk oop (oop.scm)
6. A "reacive" programming language in reactive.scm. Pretty much identical to lazy.scm with a minor (but important) difference.
